This soundscape begins by powering on the computer. \
Next you'll be able to hear some typing as I log into my computer. \
I used the effect "Amplify" to make the keystrokes more apparent. \
The effect "Noise Reduction" was used throughout the entire project on all of my original clips. \
I was able to remove background noise by creating a "Sound Profile" on the isolated background noise, \
and removing that same sound from the entire project. \
Notice how when I speak, all you hear is my voice. \
The mystery noise you might wonder "what is that?" is an app called "Discord" opening up. \
(Discord is a program that allows you to join voice calls with other people, typically used for gaming. Similar to TeamSpeak). \
Then you'll hear me give a command to Siri, telling her to put on a song. \
All of Siri's responses are clips that are cut from me having (many) other conversations with her. \
Getting Siri to say exactly what you want her to say in the script is extremely difficult and time consuming. \
The clip of the song by disturbed was reduced in volume by lowering the decibels in "Amplify" effect. \
After the music is abruptly ended, I began to set the true stage of the soundscape. \
Here I transitioned from sitting still at my desk listening to music, to getting up, grabbing my keys, and going to get coffee. \
You'll hear multiple clips overlaid at the same time as I'm walking down the stairs, while singing to myself. \
At 2:10 in the project you'll hear the sound of the car door closing behind me as I sit down into the car. \
Here in the project I began to sing more clearly, and closer to the microphone to deliver the desired effect that I'm sitting in a quiet car with good acoustics, as the car's engine is started. \
It's one of my proudest moments in the project. \
As the car's engine turns over, that is actually the end of that clip. \
I placed another clip of the engine accelerating directly after the one of the engine turning over. \
I was able to isolate a portion of this clip, copy it, and paste it again to simulate a driving sound as if the gears were shifting. \
I hope you're surprised to find out that in actuality, they were not. \
The effect "Fade in" and "Fade out" were also used on the engine clip, which is my most engineered audio sample of all. \
Due to the linearity of the time scale in this project, I was forced to incorporate an audio que that would signal that time is being sped up. \
I chose to use the clip from Spongebob because it's widely known, and also because at the end of the clip there's an audio signal that sounds like a beep to let the viewer (in this case, listener) know the scene has been cut. \
This effect transitioned perfectly into my clip of the Starbucks barista taking my order (whom I let know in advance I was recording our conversation). \
Unfortunately I don't believe he was too enthusiastic I chose him of all people to record, and he didn't say anything after I placed my order. \
The audio segment where "Sure thing man, coming right up" can be heard is actually me speaking over the background noise of the Starbucks in Target. \
I chose to leave the background noises of the coffee shop in due to purity of the sound, if they were removed then scenery of the soundscape would be diluted. \
The final audio portion is of me tapping the straw against a flat surface, and sticking the straw into the drink followed by me sighing of relief and saying the drink is delicious.
